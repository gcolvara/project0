      <p style="color: gray; font-size: 20px" align="justify">Programming is my new hobby, but not just a hobby. It is an interest that I have since I was twelve years old but, unfortunately, I have never tried to learn it until this year. Now I am like fascinated about it and I really want to learn more and follow this path in my career!</p>
      <p style="color: gray; font-size: 20px" align="justify">Until now I have learned the HTML, CSS and Flask. I am really excited to finish this course to learn all the content it will teach me and, after I finish it,  I want to add to my knowledge:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>C</li>
          <li>C++</li>
          <li>Pascal</li>
          <li>Learn things about Hacking</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Even if I don't plan to use it. I just want to learn, I swear.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Virus</li>
