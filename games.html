                  <p>My love for games started when I had like two or three years old. I used to play games on a Super Nintendo with my father, we spent a lot of time playing together in my childhood and adolescence. We used to play the entire night until the dawn every weekend. After my parents separated, when I was five years old, I started playing alone because, as I said on the <a href="sports.html" style="color: gray">Sport's Page</a>, I used to have a busy day. School, taekwondo training, soccer training every day. During the weekends, in the morning/afternoon, I prefered to play with my friends on the street because I was very hyperactive.</p>
                  <p>Have you ever had a tough day? Feeling anxious, stressed or after a frustration, play a good game helps you to relax!</p>
