              <h2 style="text-align: center;">Sports</h2>
              <p align="justify">My life in sports started early. I was a super hyperactive boy so my parents decided to take me to a Doctor to know what to do with me. So the Doctor said I should practice some sport. So my parents decided to follow what the Doctor said.</p>
                <div class="start">So, my "athletic life" started!</div>
              <p align="justify">When I was four years old, I started to train Taekwondo. But it was not enough to contain me, I was a really hard kid, I know, so I started to train Soccer too. And I kept training both sports until I was nine years old.</p>
              <div>
                <h3 style="text-align: center;">So I had to make a choice!</h3>
                <p align="justify">My father made me choose between soccer and taekwondo because I had time for nothing. In the morning I had school, in the afternoon soccer training and taekwondo training at night. I was just a nine years old kid and I didn't know why I had to choose it.</p>
              </div>
              <p align="justify">So I chose taekwondo and stop training soccer, because taekwondo was the first one I started to train. My father made me choose between both because I had time for nothing, as I said before, and I was competing in both sports and some matches were in the same day, so I couldn't handle both championships.</p>
              <p align="justify">I kept training taekwondo until my eighteen years old because I felt I made a mistake while choosing. So I start to play and training with a local team from my town, called ADG, and I felt I was on the right way now. And nowadays I am living in Hialeah, Florida, playing soccer for an University and I am very happy about it!</p>
              <p align="justify">But, even I am not fighting anymore, I like to keep trining because I really love it and, as a Brazilian, I love to watch soccer, play soccer with my friends and to play in championships.</p>
